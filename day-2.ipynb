    "\n",
    "**Objective**\n",
    "In this challenge, you will work with arithmetic operators. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task**\n",
    "Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost. Round the result to the nearest integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "A tip of 15% * 100 = 15, and the taxes are 8% * 100 = 8. Print the value  and return from the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function Description** \n",
    "Complete the solve function in the editor below.\n",
    "solve has the following parameters:\n",
    "- int meal_cost: the cost of food before tip and tax\n",
    "- int tip_percent: the tip percentage\n",
    "- int tax_percent: the tax percentage\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns The function returns nothing. Print the calculated value, rounded to the nearest integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Be sure to use precise values for your calculations, or you may end up with an incorrectly rounded result.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Format**\n",
    "There are 3 lines of numeric input: \n",
    "The first line has a double, meal_cost (the cost of the meal before tax and tip). \n",
    "The second line has an integer, tip_percent (the percentage of  being added as tip). \n",
    "The third line has an integer, tax_percent (the percentage of  being added as tax)."
